1,this is one of my favorite places to eat i love the food and atmosphere friendly staff and great ethnic food
1,today i gave rice to you a try hidden in the corner but i have to admit that i even had my doubts i ordered the curry chicken fried rice 7 50 came in a large box really hot freshly made and it tastes really good next time i would love to try the cantonese chicken or duck with my fried rice
1,yelp 100 challenge 27 100 as you enter look up at the menu and pan your eyes to the left where it says you pick 2 1 2 sandwich mediterranean veggie sandwich a choice of soup or salad cream of chicken and wild rice for only about 7 50 there s a calorie count on the right of the item for the health conscious my friends and i were given a number each and everything was brought to our table in no time very laid back bakery restaurant great place to chat the day away place smells delicious and the aroma continues to fill you up long after the meal is over affordable and good quality food
1,every time i come here the food is awesome the decor is cool vintage and i ve been coming here for 35 years never been disappointed by great burgers and awesome hush puppy shrimp great selection of tap beers as well
1,from the moment we walked into this restaurant we had a great experience the ambiance service and food quality were all top notch i love the fireplace and log cabin decor we were seated promptly and offered a garlic flatbread as a welcoming for it being our first visit we placed our orders and waited barely any time at all two burgers a pot pie bowl of corn chowder and a kid s chicken teriyaki later our appetites were fulfilled and cravings satisfied we ended the night with the butter cake dessert a butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream mint glazed strawberries garnished with basil to die for we will definitely be back maybe with our pooch seeing as how dogs are welcome on the patio seating
1,first time visiting the city and this place did not disappoint ordered two juices and the pizza abundance and veggie sandwich all were so tasty even dad who is a meat lover loved his veggie sandwich didn t even want to share any of it d
0,i ve gone to marrakech for years and it s usually a good experience but on my last visit with a groupon everything seemed to have gone downhill i think we got the same chunky cuban waiter nikki h mentioned below he was incredibly unpleasant forgot to wash our hands until it was time for dessert and he repeatedly forgot out drinks it was an adventure just trying to get a water the time before last i was here with a large party and the same chunky guy scolded my stepmom for saying she doesn t eat beef after he asked if anyone has any dietary restrictions whatever the food was the same as always with the shrimp scampi being my favorite part but they seemed to be trying to rush us out of there while taking good care of everyone else my husband even participated in the bellydancing and tipped the girls well but we were still treated like dirt overall the food is okay but i d prefer a real moroccan place where i can get some chicken bastilla service was awful bellydancers are the best in town on marrakech s facebook they act like they are so excited to have their groupon customers but that definitely wasn t the case when we went i won t be buying the groupon that s currently on sale and i doubt i ll even be back unless someone important insists on having a party there really crappy experience after i built it up to my friends
1,i m on yelp tonight to report a religious experience a euphoric climb to the pinnacle of pastadom i am referring of course to the ravioli nannina the ravioli was filled with parmesan and cooked to perfection it came in a walnut cream based sauce that was earthy yet sophisticated the rustic walnut sauce was perfectly set off by the dried cranberries sprinkled about adding just the right sweetness and acidity i am now a convert and i have to say it holy ravioli i will be very disappointed if this does not make the menu i ll be back for sure
1,the food was really good and refreshing and service was in point we really enjoyed that the manger came and greeted us because we were first timers very professional of her
1,great food and good student deals my personal favorite is a free pound of wings with purchase of any drink for students and man are the wings good service is great and the ambiance is just the way i like it it s cool that they have a volleyball court too i m hoping to go back next week and try out something else on the menu i ll keep you posted just duplicated my review for bobby o brians irish pub to here
1,great service amazing food happy we discovered this place it is in a very odd location but well worth finding enjoy
0,don t know why the address says quail hollow this restaurant is in the arboretum anyway usually ok bbq with good service however my wife orders the pulled chicken sandwich and it came this time with quite a bit of gristle so beware if you order this item never had a problem with the pulled pork
1,le cartet is a great brunch spot in old montreal while vacationing there with my family last month we came for brunch on a sunday morning i had read that the wait could get pretty long so we made sure to get there bright and early at 9 30 when we arrived it was surprisingly almost full already but luckily we were able to snag one of the few spots left at the long communal table two of us ordered the brunch toscan and the other two ordered the brunch de l atlantique the brunch plates were all huge and came with a glass of orange juice and coffee each my brunch toscan included poached eggs on english muffins with mornay sauce duck fat potatoes and fresh fruit orange grapefruit and pineapple the brunch de l atlantique included a smoked salmon bagel scrambled eggs salad sweet potato pancake and fruit everything was delicious though it seemed like the brunch de l atlantique came with a lot more food one side of the restaurant is a shop selling chocolates jams and other goods so if you end up waiting for a while you at least have something to look at while you wait definitely arrive as early as possible to avoid long lines
1,went here on a fluke what a gem food was great wine superb wait staff excellent more expensive than i thought it should be but it was a good time
0,good people watching from the patio but not much else the food is spensive unappetizing and the seating uncomfortable the only saving grace is that they serve peroni beer
1,if you re a fan on mexican food you may think it s ok to judge an establishment primarily on the taste of their guac i do just that it s great not the best go to arizona for that but it s very very good service was great too bathrooms decent recommended
0,so i was contacted by bobi l from customer service the day after my first review of smashburger i was impressed as i did not expect a response i told bobi that i thought it showed customer service actually cared what customers thought bobi offered to send smashbucks so that we could try them again i told bobi that i did not write the review hoping for a free meal but that i would send my address as requested and try again needless to say that was about a month ago and i have not heard a word since and no smashbucks maybe it takes a while to process was nice to be initially contacted but not since i still can not see us going back
1,another great lunch at ray s 2 slices with drink for 4 00 crust was just right with golden brown edges nice crisp on the bottom moist chewy in the middle and topped with a tangy tomato and milky mozzarella cheese crust has a lot of residual flour on the bottom which is perfect for me and preferable to cornmeal staff are always friendly and the atomosphere has a ny tribute theme going an older crowd was enjoying their slices at lunch today which is perfectly fine with me
1,there was a small problem that i had with my dinner i brought it to the managers attention and not only did he take care of my issues but he also promoted me to the chipotle farm club i am so excited that i am not cashing in my free food cards mike beltran is the reason i will come back to this location
1,very good food fast if you need more than 1 dozen call and place order delicious just make sure you count them they do 3k a day you know
0,4 stars for the food and boozy milkshake and 0 star for service i went on a slow tuesday night and the bartender and barback were both so rude the bartender literally threw napkins at us after we got our food never checked up on how our food drinks are
1,excellent selection and wine list server was all up on her organic grass fed finished schpiel which delighted me to no end split the shrimp tacos which were delish not a bad dish at the table i d run back
1,wow this place is so good it s cute that it s hidden i got a slice of the pepperoncini sausage it was good but i would recommend the white pizza i won t go into detail because i m already starting to crave it just get it
1,amazingly fast delicious food not enough seating would be the reason i didn t give 5 stars the food was great
1,this place is amazing it seriously has everything great beer awesome deli ridiculous things to buy and fantastic live shows how can this all exist in one place i was only in charlotte for a week so i can t say i m a pro on this city by any means but common market was by far my favorite place it was just dripping with energy and people that care about things that taste and sound great
0,had a coupon and visited tonight ordered a salad gyro and sampler chicken shawarma had good flavor but was very dry lettuce was crisp gyro was decent but as others have previously mentioned the tzatziki was like sour cream not yogurt y didn t have very good flavor we also didn t care for the baba ghanoush not enough garlic the hummus was just meh as was the tabouleh it would ve been great if they were good as not too many places to go around henderson for mediterranean food not likely to be back
1,okay so the last buffet i went to was at the mirage two or three years ago i ve never been to the bellagio buffet or the spice market at planet hollywood and the paris buffet is but a distant memory so for me this is as good as it gets the moment i laid eyes on the beautiful colorful and slightly whimsical decor of the dining area my mouth began to salivate in anticipation of good eats to come and when i finally reached the buffet it was no disappointment all strategizing went out the window as i ran around like a fat kid in a candy store seeing so many selections was sensory overload and i became nearly dizzy with piggish happiness four kinds of ceviche gourmet salads served in elegant glasses chicken panang prepared as you like it a bountiful heaping of preserved meats and cheeses a generous selection of indian cuisine lamb prepared three of four different ways rare prime rib and juicy plump sausage and tender veal steamed chinese pork buns and crispy wontons no thanks mounds of crab legs and a variety of smoked fish pasta made to order also no thanks and those were just the entrees when i saw the desserts oy vey i almost cried with joy not everything was good the scallop ceviche was a bit slimy the red snapper a bit tough but overall i was impressed i must have made four or five trips and gained five pounds that night but that s how i like to live without regrets
0,sorry folks this isn t working we tried a variety of dishes from the menu and nothing was more than meh barely there uninspired and overpriced for quality and quantity plus our server was one of those folks that maybe should be working in computers not hospitality beautiful patio too bad the food doesn t measure up that said we tried barrio cafe at the airport and had a rockin meal with great albeit slightly wack service quality control folks or maybe the scottsdale crowd just doesn t know the difference
1,amazing friendly service awesome food the portions are great it is well worth every penny we ordered the mac and cheese chicken pot pie and hand cut fries they were all so delicious
